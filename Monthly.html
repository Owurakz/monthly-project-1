<h3>
    What does Pickle Rick truly mean?
</h3>
<p>
    Arguably the most beloved episode of Rick and Morty is the classic
     "Pickle Rick," but the episode is actually a tragic metaphor for Rick and his personality. 
     "Pickle Rick" was a cultural phenomenon of its own, and for a long time 
     represented the entire Rick and Morty franchise. Sadly, the episode actually has a much deeper 
     importance, commenting on Rick's behavior and his greatest vice.

    When discussing the making of several iconic Rick and Morty episodes,
     Rick and Morty writer and co-creator Dan Harmon included the iconic Rick and Morty, season 3, episode 3, "Pickle Rick." 
     The episode depicts Rick's attempts to avoid family therapy by turning himself into a pickle. 
     This leads Rick on an adventure through the sewers where he battles a horde of violent rats. While discussing "Pickle Rick," 
     Harmon confirmed that this is actually a metaphor with a much darker 
    meaning, and has much greater ramifications than it first appeared.

<p>
    "Pickled" is a slang term meaning drunk. When Rick pickles himself,
     it is a metaphor for Rick drinking heavily.
      The Rick and Morty episode "Pickle Rick" is not really about Rick battling rats in the sewers,
    it is about an alcoholic Rick binge-drinking in a metaphorical gutter.
     While this is a frequent occurrence in other episodes, "Pickle Rick" cleverly removes all other references to alcohol. 
     As Rick and Morty's Dan Harmon points out (via GQ), this allows the metaphor to play out undisturbed, and even unnoticed. 
     "Pickle Rick" explores Rick's greatest vice, his alcoholism; 
    which is made even darker by the episode's penultimate scene.
